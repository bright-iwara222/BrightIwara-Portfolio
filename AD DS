1. Environment Setup

  1.1 Virtualization Platform

    VirtualBox (primary virtualization tool)
  Enabled:

    Virtualization (VT-x/AMD-V)
    EFI
    TPM 2.0 (when needed)

1.2 Server Configuration
Component 
Value
OS
Window Server 2022
Name
DC01
IP Address
10.59.1.50
Subnet
255.255.252.0
GateWay
10.59.1.1
DNS
10.59.1.50




2. AD DS Installation

      2.1 Installing AD DS Role

	Using PowerShell:

   powershell

	Install-WindowsFeature AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools


      2.2 Promoting the Server to a Domain Controller

  	New Forest
  	Domain: brightiwara.com
  	Forest Functional Level: Windows Server 2016+
  	DNS installed automatically
  	SYSVOL created

	After reboot → Domain Controller is active.


3. DNS Configuration

     3.1 Forward Lookup Zones

 	 `brightiwara.com` (Default)
   	Auto-created A, NS, SOA records

     3.2 Reverse Lookup Zone

	Created manually for PTR records:

  	Network: 10.59.1.0/24

    3.3 DNS Health Check

	Commands used:

   	powershell
		dcdiag /test:dns
		nslookup
		ipconfig /registerdns


	➤ Issue:  DNS Unknown
  	Fix:   Set DNS to   10.59.1.50 on the server itself.


4. DHCP Server Configuration

	Because the office network already had a DHCP server, mine wasn’t being used at first.

       	Fix strategy:

		Created a   separate NAT/Host-Only network   for the lab.
		DHCP server authorized in AD.

	4.1 DHCP Scope Setup

Parameter
Value
Scope Name
10.159.1.52- 10.59.1.200
Subnet
255.255.252.0
Gateway
10.59.1.1
DNS
10.59.1.50
Lease Time
8 days



 	4.2 DHCP Options

		Option 3 — Router
		Option 6 — DNS
		Option 15 — DNS Domain Name

      	4.3 Reservations

Reserved IPs for:

  DC01
  File Server (planned)
  WDS Server (planned)



5. Organizational Unit (OU) Structure

Created a clean enterprise-ready OU layout:

BrightIwara.com
│
├── _Workstations
├── _Servers
├── _Clients
├── _Finance
├── _GPO
└── _IT Support



6. User & Group Management

      6.1 Users

	Created test users like:

		`testuser1`
		`account.finance`

		Password policies applied.

      6.2 Security Groups

	Created:

	Finance
 	IT Support
	Domain Admin (additional user)

      Group Strategy Used:

  	AGDLP Model

		Accounts → Global → Domain Local → Permissions


7. Group Policy Management

      7.1 Important GPOs Created

	1.   Password Policy
	2.   Account Lockout Policy
	3.   Mapped Network Drive
	4.   Desktop Environment Restrictions
	5.   Block USB Storage Devices
	6.   Deploy Wallpaper

      7.2 GPO Troubleshooting Commands

   	powershell
	gpupdate /force
	gpresult 
	/rsop.msc


8. Login Script & File Shares

       8.1 Network File Share

	Created share:

     	DC01\SharedData`

      8.2 Login Script

	Example:

   	cmd
		net use M: \\dc01\shareddata /persistent:yes


	Applied via GPO.


9. Joining Windows Clients to the Domain

    Process:

	1. Set DNS to   DC01 IP
	2. Ping DC01
	3. System → Rename → Join Domain
	4. Enter domain credentials
	5. Restart
	6. Verify computer appears in  _Clients OU

Clients tested:

  Windows 10
  Windows 11 (TPM enabled in VirtualBox)


10. Backup & Restore

    Backup using Windows Server Backup

	Configured:

	*   Full Server Backup
	*   System State Backup
	*   Scheduled weekly backups

    Restore Tested

	* Restoring SYSVOL
	* Restoring AD DS DB


11. VirtualBox Networking Fixes

I solved:

	* VM stuck in Scaled Mode
	* DHCP conflicts with office network
	* Private NAT network creation
	* TPM 2.0 configuration for Windows 11
	* Expanding VDI disk (Virtual Media Manager → Resize → Diskmgmt.msc → Extend 		Volume)


12. AD Health Monitoring

Commands used:

   powershell
	dcdiag /v
	repadmin /replsummary
	repadmin /showrepl
	Get-ADDomain
	Get-ADForest


All tests passed successfully.



13. Preparing AD for Azure Hybrid

	Steps done:

	* Created Azure AD tenant
	* Created resource groups
	* Downloaded Microsoft Entra Connect
	* Installed Entra Connect on DC01
	* Enabled Password Hash Sync
	* Selected OU Filtering
	* Synced users to Azure
	* Verified Sync Status using:

  * Synchronization Service Manager
  * Entra portal → Connect Sync
